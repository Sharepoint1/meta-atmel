This Layer depends on :
URI: git://git.yoctoproject.org/poky
URI: http://git.yoctoproject.org/git/poky
Tag: yocto-1.5

OpenEmbedded/Yocto layer for for Atmel AT91SAM SoC
For now it supports:
- SAMAD3 product family (http://www.atmel.com/products/microcontrollers/arm/sama5d3.aspx)
- AT91SAM9x5 product family (AT91SAM9G15, AT91SAM9G25, AT91SAM9X25, AT91SAM9G35 and AT91SAM9X35)

It is hosted on http://github.com/linux4sam/meta-atmel

Build procedure:

1/ Clone yocto/poky git repository
git clone git://git.yoctoproject.org/poky

2/ Checkout yocto-1.5 tag
cd poky
git checkout yocto-1.5 -b my_branch

3/ Clone meta-atmel layer
git clone https://github.com/Sharepoint1/meta-atmel

4/ Initialize build directory
source oe-init-build-env build-atmel

5/ Add meta-atmel layer patch to bblayer configuration file
vim conf/bblayers.conf:

# LAYER_CONF_VERSION is increased each time build/conf/bblayers.conf
# changes incompatibly
LCONF_VERSION = "6"

BBPATH = "${TOPDIR}"
BBFILES ?= ""

BBLAYERS ?= " \
  /home/pvilchez/workspace/github/poky/meta-atmel \
  /home/pvilchez/workspace/github/poky/meta \
  /home/pvilchez/workspace/github/poky/meta-yocto \
  /home/pvilchez/workspace/github/poky/meta-yocto-bsp \
  "
5/ Edit local.conf to specify the machine, location of source archived, package type (rpm, deb or ipk)
vim conf/local.conf:
[...]
MACHINE ??= "sama5d3xek"
[...]
DL_DIR ?= "your_download_directory_path"
[...]
PACKAGE_CLASSES ?= "package_ipk"

6/ Build core minimal image
bitbake core-image-minimal

7/ We found that additional local.conf changes are needed for our QT demo
image. You can add these two lines at the end of the file:
vim conf/local.conf:
[...]
LICENSE_FLAGS_WHITELIST += "commercial"
SYSVINIT_ENABLED_GETTYS = ""

8/ Build Atmel Qt-embedded demo
bitbake atmel-qt4e-demo-image

9/ Build Atmel QT-Embedded Yocto SDK
bitbake meta-toolchain-qte
The SDK will be located here:
poky-eglibc-i686-meta-toolchain-qte-cortexa5hf-vfp-toolchain-qte-1.5.sh
To build for 64bit machine, edit conf/local.conf and set SDKMACHINE variable:
i686 for 32 bit and x86_64 for 64 bit machine.
vim conf/local.conf
[...]
#
# SDK/ADT target architecture
#
# This variable specified the architecture to build SDK/ADT items for and means
# you can build the SDK packages for architectures other than the machine you are 
# running the build on (i.e. building i686 packages on an x86_64 host._
# Supported values are i686 and x86_64
SDKMACHINE ?= "x86_64"
[...]
